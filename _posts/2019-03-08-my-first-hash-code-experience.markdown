You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hi everyone!

I’m writing today to talk you about my first experience with HashCode coding competition.

HashCode is a team coding competition organized by Google. You can form a team up to 4 people, use whatever language you are more comfortable (even more than one!) and stretch your neurons to solve a problem.

Some friends and I have been working on our coding skills for a while using coding platforms like Hackerrank, Leetcode, Topcoder… I think it is a great way to learn new things and to stay in shape.

So, when I heard about the Hashcode Competition I suggest them to participate and everyone was on board. We were very excited!

We met two times before the day of the competition. We tried the example exercise (url) in order to be familiar with the environment. Also, we talk about how to confront the problem. We decided the following:
1.	First of all, make a brainstorming. Give several ideas to solve the problem.
2.	Secondly, begin with the implementation of a score program to be able to measure our solutions without needing to upload the solution to the HashCode platform.
3.	Lastly, implement solutions starting from greedy and pseudo-greedy approaches, and improve it from there.

The competition started at 17:30 UTC and we had 4 hours. They released the problem and several datasets. Your goal is to submit a solution and an output for each of the dataset. The best score for each of the datasets adds up to your total score. So, we did as we planned, we discussed the problem to be sure we understood it correctly, and we decided a course of action.

In the end, we came up with the scoring program, a random solver to test it, and a greedy solution.  

We achieve the 1 290th position out of 6 671 participants, that we think it is not so bad, for our first time. We ended without finishing some of our tentative solutions, but overall the experience was very nice.

The whole HashCode experience was very enriching. The fact that the problem to solve is NP-hard (Wikipedia), and you must aim for a good enough solution, not only look for the best algorithm and data structure, is challenging and exciting.

We noted some things to improve for future competitions: speed up coding skills, is the scoring program necessary? maybe not, be organized and, of course, enjoy more!
Hope you liked my post! See you soon!
