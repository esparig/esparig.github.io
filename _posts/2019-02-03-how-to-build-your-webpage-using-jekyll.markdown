You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hi there! This is my first post! Welcome to everyone...

![hurra!](https://i.giphy.com/media/3ornjVEDmHQqVgF0Ri/giphy.gif)

...I'm starting the blog posting about how I built this webpage. However, this doesn't intend to be a follow along tutorial. For that there are already a lot of resources, and here I will give you some links to them.

So, let's start with the idea... I wanted a web to show up my projects. I always wanted to develop some cool ideas, but I didn't had the time (too much TV shows...). Building this webpage it's the first step to finish some of the projects I had in mind for a very long time. I read in twitter some "new year's resolution" about finishing what you started... and I realized that I needed to address that problem. These were the steps I followed:

#### 1. Using GitHub
I decided to host my webpage at GitHub, because it was very convenient. [Here](https://pages.github.com/) you can obtain more information.

#### 2. Searching for a design
 I wanted some inspiration so I began by googling: "personal web-pages", "technical personal web", "github personal page"... I found the personal website of [Yevgeniy Brikman](https://github.com/brikis98/yevgeniy-brikman-homepage). I liked a lot, so I cloned it. However I had never been heard about Jekyll, and I didn't know how to adapt their project to my website. So I decided to start from the beginning.

#### 3. What is Jekyll?
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a website generator developed in Ruby. It generates static websites, that works specially well with blogs, without needing a database. It uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki), HTML and CSS mainly, so it is easy to use. Additionally,
you have a lot of additional resources available by the community, like themes and plugins. I was already convinced, so I jumped into learning a little bit more:
* I installed Jekyll: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
  - Currently, I'm on Windows, but I use the Ubuntu Subsystem. In order to make it work I had to [disable IPv6](https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/227988887-How-to-Disable-IPv6).
* After that, I followed the Quickstart tutorial: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
* And the Step by Step tutorial, that one was specially useful: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)
When I finished reading/doing those tutorials I felt more confident about Jekyll, so I jumped into creating my own website project.

#### 4. Creating the website
As I said, I used GitHub as hosting, so I created my git repository. I chose the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), the default Jekyll theme. I worked from it, changing what I wanted, having in mind the [Yevgeniy Brikman](https://www.ybrikman.com/) website that I liked. At this point you need to know a little bit of HTML and CSS, but with a little bit of effort everything is possible.

And that's all for today! I will continue to improve this website, and posting new things soon. I hope you find this post useful!! See you in a while, crocodile!!
